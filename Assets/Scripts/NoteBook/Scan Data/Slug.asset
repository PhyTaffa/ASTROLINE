  description: A slow-moving, oversized terrestrial invertebrate that leaves behind
    a nutrient-rich slime trail. The trail stimulates local plant growth and enhances
    soil fertility, making slugs a vital part of the planetary ecosystem.
  location: Spotted near mossy lowlands, rocky paths, and beneath large bioluminescent
    plants.
  habitat: Damp forest floors, shaded cliff crevices, and nutrient-rich swamp beds.
