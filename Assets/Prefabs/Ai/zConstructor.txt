EVERY ai prefab recquire you to build it based off the situation, rember to have a "WP manager" that contains "WP"s; Assign the manager within the prefab object in the given slot; Do the same for the PathFollower and it's end and start node -> pick as the start the closest node where you place the prefab(note: there is no function that allows you to find the closest, ergo place the pregfab wherever you want. It a simple system)
